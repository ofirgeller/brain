# Simulation of Brain Neurons Firing

This project is meant as a light hearted playground.

Requirements:
* node (8.16.2 tested) 
* yarn (1.19.1 tested)

Run:
```
    yarn dev
```

TODO:
* Neurons should fire when they have received greater than threshold impulses during a time period, right now each impulse has
a constant chance of making the end neuron fire.

* Neuron population should be divided into sensory, intermediate and motor neurons.
